00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:03,497
 This is a screenshot of our meta ads manager from the last 26 hours.

2
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:08,160
 We booked five qualified leads at just 20 dirhams per lead who will get on a sales

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,820
 call with our agency to explore our full scale offer and see how we can help them

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,349
 grow their business in 2025.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,060
Now, even if we close one of these five

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:19,980
 qualified leads, our customer acquisition costs for our full scale offer will only

7
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:24,840
 be 100 dirhams of ad spend, which is a tiny fraction of the price of our packages.

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:28,300
 Now, I have to be honest with you, it wasn't always this simple for us.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,600
 It was only months ago where my partner and I were spending thousands of

10
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:35,120
 dollars every single month on figuring out a system that would bring us clients.

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:39,380
 Who one needed exactly what we had to sell to have the budget to pay for our

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:43,340
 services and three were ready to get started with our agency ASAP and after

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,190
 Over years of trial and error, we finally came across a system that started working

14
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:50,350
 for us consistently and growing our business month after month.

15
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:51,550
 And that's where everything clicked.

16
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:55,910
 We started growing, expanding the team, and we even moved out to an office in the heart

17
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:59,170
 of Dubai, which is exactly where I'm recording this video from right now.

18
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:00,590
 So what suddenly changed?

19
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:04,430
 How do we go from a couple of broke, burnt out guys in their twenties to operating an

20
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,910
 agency that has helped 50 plus businesses consistently grow month after month?

21
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,370
 We'll explain it all in this very short video.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,779
 My name is Mohan, and what I'm about to share with you could completely transform how your business can grow in 2025.

23
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:23,180
 Now, before I move into exactly how the system works, I want to first focus on you and your business specifically.

24
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:26,699
 If you're watching this video, it's probably because of one of three reasons.

25
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:33,600
 One, you've trusted other freelancers or agencies with your business's marketing, but you've been burned so far with really bad results.

26
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:41,400
 Two, you've tried running ads, posting on social media, and taking on all of the marketing tasks yourself, but haven't seen any real changes so far.

27
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,480
 Three, you've never had a proper marketing system

28
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:46,180
 for your business and you're looking to grow ASAP.

29
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,420
 What all of these three categories have in common

30
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:50,580
 is that they're currently starving their business of cash

31
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,380
 because they don't have a reliable

32
00:01:52,684 --> 00:01:53,820
 customer acquisition strategy

33
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:55,757
 that can feed their business month after month.

34
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,300
 What makes XMA different is that we've developed

35
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,320
 a complete digital marketing ecosystem

36
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:03,040
 that combines content production, advertising,

37
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,680
 CRM solutions, and AI automations into one cohesive system,

38
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,780
 which we call the Link Flow system.

39
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,870
 And the lead flow system is a full solution where every component of your marketing machine

40
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:18,730
 works together to generate leads, nourish prospects, and help convert them into paying

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,106
 customers.

42
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:23,250
 And we've been able to implement this exact system for over 50 clients so far.

43
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:25,050
 Take this luxury bag brand, for example.

44
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:29,288
 We took them from a couple thousand dirhams all the way up to 400,000 dirhams in generated

45
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,483
 revenue, and we increased their customer retention rate to 12.65%, which is in the top 1% of

46
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:36,930
 the industry for a luxury brand.

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,740
 We also work with the UAE commerce phenomenon, The Flower Guys, who took Dubai by storm in 2025.

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,960
 We built their website, optimized their landing page, ran their ad campaigns, and even created content for their business,

49
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,958
 a bunch of which were in collaboration with Noon.com.

50
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,680
 Or take Formatic Car Infos, who have been using our lead flow system for months.

51
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,700
 Aside from generating them qualified leads every single day,

52
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:03,160
 we also created a brand new, optimized landing page for them, which has significantly increased their conversion rates.

53
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:07,470
 Or take a look at PacMat, one of the UAE's leading e-commerce software companies.

54
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,490
 They have been a client of ours for over three years and use our exact

55
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,970
 workflow system to generate qualified prospects for their business month after month.

56
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:19,350
 So you don't need a seven figure marketing department to grow your business exponentially in 2025.

57
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,640
 All you need is the right system.

58
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,380
 And if you start now, if you implement the right system into your business today,

59
00:03:26,721 --> 00:03:31,000
 the gap between you and your competitors will go exponentially every single week.

60
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,580
 Because while they're out there testing different marketing trends,

61
00:03:33,962 --> 00:03:36,600
 jumping between agencies or hiring cheap freelancers,

62
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:38,500
 you're just doing what's working,

63
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:41,920
 driving the gap between you and your competitors even further.

64
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,480
 Now aside from some of the client wins I shared with you earlier,

65
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,720
 so far we've been able to manage over 3 million dirhams in ad spend.

66
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:50,210
 generate over 30,000 qualified leads,

67
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:54,150
 and have produced over 300 video ads that have converted browsers into buyers.

68
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:55,650
 So what makes our system work?

69
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,510
 Well, the game of advertising is actually very straightforward.

70
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:01,370
 One, you pay money to get your message in front of strangers.

71
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,910
 Two, a percent of those strangers will become leads.

72
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,490
 Three, a percent of those leads will become customers.

73
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,170
 And four, at the end of it all, the money you made should have exceeded what you spent.

74
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:15,010
 So in principle, success is when you put a dollar in and get two plus dollars back for your business.

75
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:19,860
 In order for you to win at this game, you need to make sure that your system is acting like a machine

76
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:23,400
 that is constantly pushing strangers to become customers every single day.

77
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,920
 And this is where our complete process comes into play.

78
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:30,140
 The first step of our complete lead flow solution is to create high quality ads for your business.

79
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,810
 And we do this from A to Z for all of our clients,

80
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:34,890
 meaning one, we'll analyze your business

81
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:35,889
 and research your industry.

82
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,569
 Two, have our copywriters craft persuasive scripts

83
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:40,470
 that address your prospects' pain points,

84
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,850
 present a solution, and hook your audience in

85
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:43,710
 from start to finish.

86
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,750
 Then our team of professional videographers

87
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,950
 will come to your business with a model of your choosing

88
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,590
 and shoot all of your ads in one day.

89
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,619
 And lastly, our team of editors will then take that raw footage and

90
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:56,600
 transform it into conversion focused ads that are meant to drive action.

91
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,980
 Once content creation is done, the second step is an integrating our

92
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:03,920
 custom CRM solution, which is the backbone of your lead management process.

93
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:07,380
 The CRM system will instantly capture your leads from meta ad platforms,

94
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:10,439
 respond to new leads that have come through the door immediately, and

95
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,880
 have a custom AI chatbot engage with your prospect and push them

96
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:14,920
 further down your pipeline.

97
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,720
 On average, prospects who receive an immediate follow-up

98
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,480
 are seven times more likely to book a sales call

99
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:23,120
 and five times more likely to become customers.

100
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,280
 The best part is we set it all up for you.

101
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:27,260
 The custom fields, automated workflows,

102
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,600
 WhatsApp templates, and AI chatbot instructions

103
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:32,660
 Everything will be configured specifically for your business.

104
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,640
 Once the CRM is set up, the third step is launching your ads.

105
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:40,520
 This is where we put your ads in front of your ideal customer profile to generate you quality leads consistently,

106
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,320
 which ends up feeding the CRM and pushing prospects further down your pipeline.

107
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,400
 And the fourth and final component is your campaign management,

108
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,600
 where we monitor and optimize your ad campaigns to make sure your pipeline is always filled with quality leads

109
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,660
 and your CRM and AI automations are fully sustained.

110
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:58,550
 So now that you know exactly what you need to do

111
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,950
 to take your marketing to the next level in 2025,

112
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:02,790
 you're faced with three options.

113
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,190
 You can continue what you're doing,

114
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,590
 move down the same path and hope for different results.

115
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:08,550
 You can try and replicate the system yourself,

116
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:11,310
 which can take months and thousands of dollars to pull off,

117
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,430
 or you can partner with us and implement the Leadflow system

118
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,250
 into your business in a matter of weeks.

119
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:17,390
 Now, I understand this is an important decision

120
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:17,970
 for you to make.

121
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,310
 This is why we look forward to having you on a call with us

122
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,230
 so we can discuss in detail exactly how we can help

123
00:06:23,352 --> 00:06:24,228
 your business grow in 2025.

124
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,800
 Thanks for watching this video.

125
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:26,920
 I hope it's been informative

126
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,140
 and I look forward to seeing you on our call.
